                                <p>
                                I was born in Ft. Campbell, Kentucky, adopted two years later in San Antonio, and raised in Austin.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                My hobbies would currently include working out 5-6 days of the week (mainly running, but some core and weight activity as well), playing Call of Duty on the Xbox, watching Stranger Things and other cool shows with my family, and having as many date nights with the wife as possible (even if that now means we just cuddle on the back porch all night).  I love taking the family on trips, and look forward to ending this virus so we may resume our travels.  I love practicing Jiu Jitsu with the kids, and love watching them at their tournaments and coming home with medals, belts, and katanas won from tournaments.  I love riding my Sunday Scout BMX bike (local Austin brand!)  I love taking care of my garden, as I aim to be self sufficient and have enough berries and power greens to sustain daily smoothies!  I love running with my dog, Brody.  I love Rage Against The Machine (no I didn't jump on the bandwagon and start listening to them 3 months ago, more like 23 years ago.)
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                My childhood was spent riding BMX and Mountain Bikes, swimming, hiking in Barton Creek, building things with my dad, and playing and watching sports.  My two favorite sports to play were soccer and basketball, and the two sports I was the best at were soccer and track.  I played soccer at a high level from age 3 until around age 15.  My parents pushed me very hard in track, once they learned that at 7 years old in P.E., I ran a 7:11 minute mile.  From the moment they found out about that, they brought in a trainer to help maximize my potential.  I did very well, but burned out pretty quickly, officially quitting track around age 15, but really burned out since age 12.  Some of my highlights were at age 12, running a 4:52 minute mile, winning many local 5K's (even setting a state record for ages 12 and under at a Round Rock 5K by finishing in 16:16), and at age 11, placing second in the 19 and under age group in the St. Michael's 8K, finishing in 28:32 minutes.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                High school was a struggle, but mostly because I was in a very rebellious stage.  I went to Westlake High School through around the middle of my junior year, transferred to a few different schools, before finally settling and graduating at L.C. Anderson High School.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                Afterwards, I joined a local chapter of Americorps called CasaVerde, located in downtown Austin, where I learned how to build and install cabinets, doors, and countertops while on a year contract with Americorps, doing volunteer work for Habitat for Humanity on the weekends here and there.  I picked up woodworking and surveying skills at Austin Community College shortly after that, while working at restaurants and fast food places to get by.  After that, I went to Southwest School of Electronics (no longer a school) and earned an Associates in Occupational Studies, with a focus in electronics.  I also did a stint as commercial electrician apprentice, before the economy tanked and many including myself lost their jobs.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                Fast forward several jobs later, and it's 2009.  I just moved back from a near 6 year stay in Chicago, am now a father of two, and I'm back in Austin to help my mom take care of my ailing dad.  I found a company called Multimedia Games, which produces and manufactures electronic slot machines for Casinos.  They were considering me for a position created to install custom laminate on the machines.  They decided not to fill that position, but they did want to bring me on in the computer repair department.  I spent some time in that department before transferring into Quality Control.  Turns out I had an eye for Quality, and I spent the next 7 years in Quality with that company.  During that time, I also got certified as a Lean Six Sigma Green Belt.  I switched from Quality, to the Engineering Services department, as a Continuous Improvement Specialist in the Project Management Professional's group, and as my department's liason to Manufacturing, as well as Manufacturing's liason to Corporate.  I spent a few years in that role making many valuable improvements across the company, but I wanted to learn more of the business.  I always wanted to have the most overall knowledge of the company, teams, products, and processes, so I could market myself, as well as be of greater value to the company.  I transitioned to the Gaming Operations department, who handles the analysis of game and machine performance at the Casinos, and who was responsible for the high value add on customizations which add a major "pop" to the viewer and player.  I handled the procurement and stocking management of these high value, long lead time parts, as an Asset Inventory Management Specialist.  I only got to do that for one year before Covid-19 hit, 97% of us got furloughed, and eventually over 30% of us including myself were laid off.

                                During my time as a Continuous Improvement Specialist, I always wanted to take courses to gain web development skills, because I knew how much that would benefit me on the improvements I've come up with for the projects I'm working on, rather than waiting for six months for the development team to finally put my ticket in the next quarter's sprint, I could save 6-9 months and do the development myself.

                                I am now happily in the Full Stack Flex Boot Camp Course at The University of Texas, and I look forward to what the future holds!!!
